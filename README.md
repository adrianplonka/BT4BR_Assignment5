### Adding your first file


```bash
touch Hello_World.py
```

 > This command will create a Hello_World.py file
 > Now you edit this file with editors like gedit, nano etc.
 
 ```bash
 gedit Hello_World.py
 ```
 
 > Now you have to use *git add* command to add your script to the **staging area**
 
 ```bash
 git add -u "Hello_World.py"
 ```
 > Now you have to commit your changes
 > - *git commit* 
 > - *-m* flag to name your commit
 
 ```bash
 git commit -m "My first commit"
 ```
 
 > Finally you will push changes to GitHub repository
 
 ```bash
 git push origin
 ```
 
##### **Good Job!**  
 **You have succesfully added your first python script to your repository!**

###### Branching 

Branching allows to diverge from the main branch. After that you can merge your branches (*beware merging conflict*) or if you like your new branch you can make it the main one!
